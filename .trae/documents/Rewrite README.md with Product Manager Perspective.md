I will rewrite the README.md to present a compelling product narrative from a senior product manager's perspective. The new README will:

1. **Lead with value proposition** - Start with why this matters
2. **Competitive differentiation** - Explicitly compare with existing Python-based MCP servers
3. **Problem-solution framework** - Address real-world pain points
4. **Feature highlights** - Use bullet points extensively
5. **Production-ready focus** - Emphasize enterprise features
6. **Technical advantages** - TypeScript benefits over Python
7. **Use cases** - Real-world scenarios
8. **Quick start** - Keep installation simple but thorough

The rewritten README will maintain all technical accuracy while being more engaging and product-focused.
